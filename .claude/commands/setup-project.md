# Setup Project - SubForge Context Engineering Command

**Command**: `/setup-project`  
**Purpose**: Analyze project and create comprehensive Claude Code configuration  
**Inspired by**: Context Engineering methodology

## Command Description

This command combines SubForge's Factory Pattern with Context Engineering principles to analyze your project and generate an optimal Claude Code configuration with specialized agents and workflows.

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Project Analysis + Context Engineering
1. **Deep Project Analysis**
   - Analyze codebase structure and patterns
   - Detect technology stack and architecture
   - Identify team size and complexity requirements
   - Generate comprehensive project profile

2. **Context Package Generation**
   - Create rich context with examples and patterns
   - Identify relevant best practices
   - Generate validation gates
   - Build reference documentation

### Phase 2: PRP Generation
1. **Product Requirements Prompt Creation**
   - Generate structured prompts for each factory component
   - Include comprehensive context and examples
   - Define success criteria and validation checkpoints
   - Create executable validation gates

### Phase 3: Factory Execution
1. **Parallel Component Generation**
   - Execute specialized factory subagents with full context
   - Generate CLAUDE.md with project-specific configuration
   - Create optimized agent team with clear specializations
   - Build custom workflows and automation commands

2. **Integration & Validation**
   - Integrate all generated components
   - Run comprehensive validation gates
   - Generate deployment plan with rollback options
   - Create usage documentation

## Execution

Execute the SubForge system directly:

```python
import asyncio
from subforge.core.workflow_orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator

async def setup_project(user_request="Set up intelligent development environment"):
    orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()
    result = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(user_request, ".")
    print(f"âœ… SubForge setup complete! Generated {len(result.template_selections.get('selected_templates', []))} agents.")
    return result

# Execute SubForge
asyncio.run(setup_project("Create complete development environment with intelligent agents"))
```

## What Gets Generated

### Core Configuration
- **CLAUDE.md**: Complete project configuration with build commands, workflows, and agent coordination
- **Agent Team**: Specialized agents tailored to your technology stack and architecture
- **Custom Workflows**: Development processes optimized for your project pattern

### Quality Assurance  
- **Validation Gates**: Executable quality checks and tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage guides and best practices
- **Rollback Plan**: Safe deployment with recovery procedures

### Context Artifacts
- **PRP Files**: Product Requirements Prompts for future iterations
- **Context Library**: Rich context packages for consistent quality
- **Usage Examples**: Project-specific examples and patterns

## Context Engineering Approach

This command implements **"Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering"** by:

1. **Rich Context**: Every factory component gets comprehensive context with examples, patterns, and validation gates
2. **Structured Prompts**: PRPs ensure consistent, high-quality execution with minimal iterations  
3. **Validation First**: Executable validation gates ensure quality at every step
4. **Documentation**: Complete context preservation for future improvements

## Success Criteria

- **Analysis Accuracy**: > 95% accurate technology and architecture detection
- **First-Run Success**: > 85% of configurations work immediately without manual fixes
- **Quality Consistency**: All generated components meet established quality standards
- **Time Efficiency**: Complete setup in < 10 minutes for most projects

## Integration with Existing Workflow

This command enhances (doesn't replace) your existing development workflow by:
- Adding intelligent agent specialization based on your actual codebase
- Creating project-specific automation and quality gates
- Providing context-rich documentation and examples
- Enabling rapid onboarding for new team members
